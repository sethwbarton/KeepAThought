  <p>On Keep A Thought, you don't have to deal with ads, you don't have to post what you write, you don't even have to look at what other people are writing - but you can if you want.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
  <h1 class="AboutSubHeader">Write What You're Thinking.</h1>
  <p>You can write right away! Just make an account and you're in action. You can keep a thought personal so no one can read it, or make it public so those who follow you can see it.</p>

  <h1 class="AboutSubHeader">It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature!</h1>
